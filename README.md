A Wittgensteinian game about regular expressions, made for the
Noisebridge Perl Jam!

We'll generate a random pair of regular expressions, the Goal and the
Distractor, and then show you ten strings that the Goal will match. Then
we'll show you some more strings, that are randomly generated by either
the Goal or the Distractor. You have to decide whether or not the Goal
was responsible for the string.

Keep in mind! This is technically impossible! (Kripke, 1982)

Good luck!
